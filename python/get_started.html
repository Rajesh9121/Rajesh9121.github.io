        <h2>Python Install</h2>
        <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</p>
        <p>To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the
            following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):</p>
        <pre><code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code></pre>
        <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open
            the Terminal and type:</p>
        <pre>python --version</pre>
        <p>If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from
            the following website: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a> </p>
        <h2>Python Quickstart</h2>
        <p>Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in
            a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.</p>
        <p>The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:</p>
        <pre> C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</pre>
        <p>Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.</p>
        <p>Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.</p>
        <pre><code><span class="green">print</span>(<span class="double-quote">"</span>Hello world<span class="double-quote">"</span>)</code></pre>
        <p>Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file,
            and run:</p>
        <pre>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</pre>
        <p>The output should read:</p>
        <pre>Hello, World!</pre>
        <p>Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.</p>
        <h2>The Python Command Line</h2>
        <p>To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a
            file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.</p>
        <p>Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:</p>
        <pre>C:\Users\Your Name>python</pre>
        <p>Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":</p>
        <pre>C:\Users\Your Name>py</pre>
        <p>From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:</p>
        <pre><code>C:\Users\Your Name>python
Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
        <p>Which will write "Hello, World!" in the command line:</p>
        <pre><code>C:\Users\Your Name>python
Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!</code></pre>
        <p>Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python
            command line interface:</p>
        <pre>exit()</pre>
